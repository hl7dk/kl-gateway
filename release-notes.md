New release of KL-Gateway for nursing and home care

Updated to be compliant with the simplification of FSIII (Forenklingen), but without breaking changes. Old FSIII codes and terms are still accepted. A new encounter called GeneralEncounter has been included.
The citizen profile has two new attributes: Patient.active and Patient.deceased.
